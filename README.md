Built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, **Pug**, and other modern web technologies, HappyTrails ensures a smooth and engaging experience.

## How I Built It

- Designed a **RESTful API** to manage users and authentication.
- Utilized **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for secure authentication and session management.
- Configured **MongoDB** as the database with **Mongoose ORM** for schema validation and data management.
- Used **Pug** for server-side rendering (SSR).
- Designed a responsive UI with **CSS** .
- Integrated **MapBox** to provide interactive maps.
- Utilized **Multer** for handling user profile photo uploads.
